      <p>Spanning a wide range of technologies and industries, projects have included:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>developed <strong>Channel Nine&#8217;s live cricket coverage</strong> &#8211; computerised game tracking and graphical display of game statistics.</li>
		<li>computerisation of <strong>Channel Nine&#8217;s National Election Coverage</strong>, broadcasting live data and forecasts from the tally room.</li>
		<li>developed <strong>Bain &#38; Co&#8217;s multi-user money-market system</strong> on a micro and then ported it to a mini. Bain &#38; Co (now part of Deutsche Bank) were one of Australia&#8217;s largest stock-broking firms.</li>
		<li>developed a <strong>bond-valuation system for Bain &#38; Co.</strong> An algorithm designed by us was able to value a bond portfolio in 20 seconds &#8211; a task that had been taking 7 minutes on their mainframe.</li>
		<li>solved problem for client who had legacy code running on a proprietary operating system. Their software supplier was unable to port the software to Windows. We solved this problem by <strong>developing an operating system emulator</strong>. Hundreds of operating system calls were emulated. Included in the task was the development of a program loader. Under our emulator, the legacy application was able to complete its 10 hour processing run in only 10 minutes. Data transfer from the old system was effected by plugging the legacy hard disk drive into a PC controller and using low-level routines to read the old hard disk drive physically track-by-track and then implementing the legacy file system so that the database files could be logically accessed.</li>
		<li><strong>solved <span class="caps">Y2K</span> problems in application software for which the client had no access to the source code</strong>. This was accomplished through disassembly to identify all the date processing code, and then developing software that patched the binary executable image to correct the faulty code.</li>
		<li>developed a <strong>paperless warehouse picking system for Mayne Nickless that handles 10,000 picks per day.</strong></li>
		<li>developed a <strong>database and reporting system for an international audiotext provider, processing 3.5 million call records per month</strong>. 11 million minutes of telephone call record data was received from telcos and call-answering equipment in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong, and Chile. These data were stored in a database in Sydney. The 2.7Gb monthly database was processed to analyse traffic patterns, perform statistical analyses, detect anomalies including fraud, and to provide a wide variety of management reports to the company&#8217;s offices in Hong Kong, Auckland, Nice, and London.</li>
